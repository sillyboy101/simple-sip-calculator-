#Interactive SIP Calculator with Matplotlib and ipywidgets

This project provides a simple yet powerful interactive calculator to estimate the future value of a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) with variable interest rates using Python. Built primarily for Jupyter Notebook environments, it combines the flexibility of Matplotlib visualization with the interactivity of ipywidgets sliders.

Key Features
Interactive Sliders: Adjust monthly SIP amount, investment duration (years), and interest rate range seamlessly using intuitive sliders.

Real-time Plot Updates: Visualizes how SIP returns change dynamically as you tweak parameters.

Clear Visualization: Displays the growth of your investment against varying interest rates, helping you make informed financial decisions.

Easy to Use: Minimal dependencies, designed to work smoothly in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab without complex installations.

Educational Tool: Useful for students, financial enthusiasts, and anyone interested in understanding SIP growth patterns with different scenarios.

How It Works
The core logic calculates the future value (FV) of monthly SIP contributions using the compound interest formula adapted for monthly investments. The tool computes SIP FV over a user-defined range of interest rates and plots the result interactively.

Usage
Run the notebook and use the sliders to:

Set your monthly SIP investment amount.

Specify how many years you plan to invest.

Choose the interest rate range to explore potential returns.

The graph updates live, showing you the future value across the range of interest rates selected.

Technologies Used
Python 3

Matplotlib for plotting

ipywidgets for interactive UI controls

Who Should Use This
Electronics or finance students learning investment concept simulations.

Developers and quantitative analysts aiming to prototype financial calculators.

Anyone curious about SIP planning and impact of interest rates on investments.
